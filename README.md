# Real-Time-Data-Streaming-using-Apache-Nifi-AWS-Snowpipe-Stream-Task

### This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time data streaming pipeline using Apache NiFi, AWS S3, Snowflake Snowpipe, and Snowflake Streams & Tasks. The goal is to automate the ingestion, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data while ensuring minimal latency and enabling real-time business insights.

### The architecture is designed to process large-scale data efficiently by leveraging cloud-native tools. This solution is ideal for organizations looking to monitor and analyze real-time data streams.

### Features

- Real-time data ingestion using Apache NiFi.

- Seamless data transfer to AWS S3 for storage.

- Automated data loading using Snowpipe.

- Data transformation and processing using Snowflake Streams & Tasks.

- Error handling and monitoring.

- Scalable and cost-effective architecture.

### Tech Stack

1. Apache NiFi: Data ingestion and transformation.

2. AWS S3: Cloud storage for raw data.

3. Snowflake Snowpipe: Continuous data loading.

4. Snowflake Streams & Tasks: Real-time data processing.

5. Python: For scripting and automation.

6. SQL: Data manipulation and querying.
